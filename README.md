# Codelabs

This repository contains getting started codelabs for the Web Animations API.

Right now, there's a single Google I/O 2015 codelab. For its steps and work, please check out the [Google I/O codelabs site](https://io2015codelabs.appspot.com/codelabs/web-animations-transitions-playbackcontrol).

## Background

Web Animations is a new JavaScript API for driving animated content on the web. By unifying the animation features of SVG and CSS, Web Animations unlocks features previously only usable declaratively, and exposes powerful, high-performance animation capabilities to developers.

For more details see the [W3C specification](http://w3c.github.io/web-animations/), or the [JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js).
